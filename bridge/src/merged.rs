//!
//! * **get_block_template** returns a native ZKas template, or a real Kaspa/Sedra
//!   template with a coinbase commitment to the ZKas block hash `H_fc`.
//! * Parent and child difficulties are independent. Each solved leg is submitted

//! * Missing/unavailable parents fall back to native ZKas. The synthetic builder
